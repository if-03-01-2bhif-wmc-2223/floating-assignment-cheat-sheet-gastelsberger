            Web Client:
            The web client is also known as browser. It gets information from the web server (via the internet). The client serves
            as application software (program designed to carry out a specific task) for accessing the world wide web. 
            The client does things such as rendering, fancy GUI stuff and it requests a new page when required. <br/>
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <br/>
            Process:
            A URL is entered to the browser, which retrieves information from the browser using the appropriate protocol.
            Communication between the browser and the web server is encrypted for security/privacy reasons. Once the pages were 
            retrieved, the rendering engine displays it on the users device. When a hyperlink is clicked, a new resource will be
            opened. Most browsers have an internal cache to reduce loading times.
        </p>

            Web Server:<br/>
            A webserver is a computer software with underlying hardware that accepts requests in HTTP or HTTPS. It can contain
            pre-existing files (static content) or the content can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content).
            More information to be found below.<br/>
            <br/>
            The web server houses HTML content. <br/>
            <br/>
            The server side static houses files, which can be retrieved at some point. There are no scripts whatsoever in that type 
            of webpage.<br/>
            <br/>
            Server side dynamics exist too, applying to sites that are powered by scripts to make them dynamic (kind of obvious).<br/> 
            <br/>
            Then you also have database driven webpages, which are scripted and have a database behind it. The scripting makes a 
            query and receives data in return.<br/>

            The internet was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) at around
            1989. He had the first World Wide Web Browser and a HTTP server ready by the end of 1990. He also founded the WWC
            Consortium (W3C), which created XML (Extendible Markup Language). <br/>
            <br/>
            W3C recommended replacing HTML with XHTML, which failed and instead HTML5 was developed by global players.

            'URL' is the abbreviation for Uniform Resource Locator, colloquially known as web address. The purposse of a URL is to
            identify and locate resources, such as websites, using a protocol and the resource in a network. The syntax is simple:<br/>
            <br/>
            PROTOCOL :// PATH ? #<br/>
            The paths are seperated with a slash, the '?' is a query and # is the fragment.<br/>
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The correct doctype declaration is "!DOCTYPE html" (don't forget the greater/smaller characters).<br/>
            <br/>
            HTML elements have a starting tag, (name) and an ending tag. Void elements do not have end tags and can't house any 
            content inside it. These elements have attributes and can't be nested.<br/>
            <br/>
            The id atribute is a unique ID for a HTML element and must be unique within the HTML document. This attribute is used 
            to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. JavaScript also uses this to access and manipulate the 
            element with the specific id.<br/> 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>DO NOT FORGET THE GREATER/SMALLER CHARS</b><br/>
            Special tags are:<br/>
            img src="IMAGE NAME"<br/>
            a href="LINK" (TEXT)<br/>
            meta (NAME)="TYPE"<br/>
            <br/>
            How to comment:<br/>
            !-- (TEXT) --<br/>
        </p>
